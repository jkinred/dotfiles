- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice
grammar for the sake of concision.

## Presenting Options

When providing options, summarise the options in a numbered list -- from least
to most recommended -- at the end of any detailed section, followed by your
recommendation with a short justification.

## Plans

At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if
any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of
concision.
